1.	Detect/identify faces in an image (using a face detection model) — for simplicity, this tutorial will only use images with one face/person in it, not more/less
2.	Predict face poses/landmarks (for the faces identified in step 1)
3.	Using data from step 2 and the actual image, calculate face encodings(numbers that describe the face)
4.	Compare the face encodings of known faces with those from test images to tell who is in the picture



Step 4: Finding the person’s name from the encoding
Step 3: Encoding Faces
Step 2: Posing and Projecting Faces
Step 1: Finding all the Faces




1.	First, look at a picture and find all the faces in it
2.	Second, focus on each face and be able to understand that even if a face is turned in a weird direction or in bad lighting, it is still the same person.
3.	Third, be able to pick out unique features of the face that you can use to tell it apart from other people— like how big the eyes are, how long the face is, etc.
4.	Finally, compare the unique features of that face to all the people you already know to determine the person’s name.
